            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>Hey there! I’m Veríssimo, and this is my story of learning Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Pulumi.</p>
            <p>I used to spend hours clicking around in the AWS console to set up EC2 instances and S3 buckets. It was tedious and slow! Everything changed when I discovered Pulumi. With it, I wrote Python code to automate everything—from an EC2 instance to the static site you’re looking at right now, hosted on S3 with CloudFront for extra speed.</p>
            <p>I hit a snag early on: my Windows username, "Veríssimo," has an accent, which messed up Pulumi’s paths. I tried switching to "Verissimo" without the accent, but after rebooting, my password stopped working—total chaos! Luckily, I have a dual-boot setup with Ubuntu. I switched over, set everything up in a flash, and boom: it worked!</p>
            <p>With Pulumi, I built:
                <ul>
                    <li>A simple EC2 instance to get started.</li>
                    <li>An S3 bucket turned into a static website.</li>
                    <li>A CloudFront CDN to make this site fast and secure!</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
